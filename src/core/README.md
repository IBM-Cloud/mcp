# IBMCloud MCP Server - Core

This project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for IBM Cloud core tools.

## ⚙️ Configurations

The following example MCP configurations can be found in the `configs` folder to help get started with code engine use cases:

- [mcp.all-tools.json](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/ibmcloud-mcp-server/blob/main/src/core/configs/mcp.all-tools.json) - By not specifying an mcp-tools filter argument, *all* (1000+!) tools will be exposed to the mcp host application.  This can be useful for understanding the names.  However, the large number of tools will exceed the context window size of LLM's, so this config is only useful for debugging.
- [mcp.account.json](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/ibmcloud-mcp-server/blob/main/src/core/configs/mcp.account.json) - Tools commonly used when working with Accounts and Users
- [mcp.catalog.json](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/ibmcloud-mcp-server/blob/main/src/core/configs/mcp.catalog.json) - Tools for working with services and offerings in the IBM Cloud catalog.
- [mcp.assist.json](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/ibmcloud-mcp-server/blob/main/src/core/configs/mcp.assist.json) - Tool to invoke the IBM Cloud Assistant that has been trained on all the IBM Cloud documentation to answer IBM Cloud-specific questions.
- [mcp.billing.json](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/ibmcloud-mcp-server/blob/main/src/core/configs/mcp.billing.json) - Tools for querying billing and usage information for your accounts.
- [mcp.config.json](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/ibmcloud-mcp-server/blob/main/src/core/configs/mcp.config.json) - Tools for adjusting common configuration settings for IBM Cloud mcp tools, such as display formats.
- [mcp.dev.json](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/ibmcloud-mcp-server/blob/main/src/core/configs/mcp.dev.json) - Tools for working with toolchains and pipelines (tekton).

## 🧾 Prerequisites

To build, run, and deploy this project, you will need the following installed:

- `make`
- Containerization tool: `podman` or `docker`
- `curl` (for testing)
- [`hadolint`](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint?tab=readme-ov-file#install) (for linting Containerfiles)
- [`dockle`](https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle) (for linting container images)
- [`trivy`](https://trivy.dev/v0.60/getting-started/installation/) (for scanning container images for vulnerabilities)
- IBM Cloud CLI with `container-registry` and `code-engine` plugins

## 🗜️ Building the Container Image

The project uses a `Containerfile` to define the container image. You can build the image using either Podman or Docker via the Makefile targets.

An optional paramater of `IBMCLOUD_PLUGINS=one,two,three` can be added to the following build commands. All plugins will be installed if this is not provided.

* **Using Podman (Production image):**

    ```bash
    make podman
    ```

* **Using Docker (Production image):**

    ```bash
    make docker
    ```

## Running the Container with an MCP Client

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "ibmcloud-core": {
            "command": "/opt/podman/bin/podman",
            "args": [
                "run",
                "-i",
                "--rm",
                "-e",
                "IBMCLOUD_API_KEY",
                "-e",
                "IBMCLOUD_REGION",
                "-e",
                "IBMCLOUD_RESOURCE_GROUP",
                "-e",
                "IBMCLOUD_MCP_TOOLS",
                "-e",
                "IBMCLOUD_MCP_TRANSPORT",
                "ibmcloud-mcpserver/ibmcloud-mcpserver"
            ],
            "env": {
                "IBMCLOUD_API_KEY": "<Your API key",
                "IBMCLOUD_REGION": "us-south",
                "IBMCLOUD_RESOURCE_GROUP": "default",
                "IBMCLOUD_MCP_TOOLS": "<comma,separated,list,of,tools,to,enable>",
                "IBMCLOUD_MCP_TRANSPORT": "<stdio || sse>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 🏃🏽‍♀️ Running the Container Locally

You can run the built container image locally using the `make` targets for Podman or Docker.

Ensure you have a `.env` file in the project root. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the values.

* **Running with Podman (HTTP on port 4141):**

    ```bash
    make podman-run
    ```

* **Running with Podman (HTTPS on port 4141):**

    ```bash
    make podman-run-ssl
    ```

* **Running with Docker (HTTP on port 4141):**

    ```bash
    make docker-run
    ```

* **Running with Docker (HTTPS on port 4141):**

    ```bash
    make docker-run-ssl
    ```

## ✋🏼 Stopping the Container

Stop and remove the running container instance:

* **Using Podman:**

    ```bash
    make podman-stop
    ```

* **Using Docker:**

    ```bash
    make docker-stop
    ```

## 🧪 Testing the Container

Use `curl` to quickly test the running container endpoint:

* **Using Podman:**

    ```bash
    make podman-test
    ```

* **Using Docker:**

    ```bash
    make docker-test
    ```

## 👮🏼 Security Scanning

The Makefile includes targets for scanning your `Containerfile` and built images for vulnerabilities and best practices.

* **Scan image for CVEs (HIGH/CRITICAL) using Trivy:**

    ```bash
    make trivy
    ```

* **Lint container image using Dockle:**

    ```bash
    make dockle
    ```

* **Lint Containerfile(s) using Hadolint:**

    ```bash
    make hadolint
    ```
