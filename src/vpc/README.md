# IBMCloud MCP Server - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

This project provides a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for tools for working with VPC resources.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configurations

The following example MCP configurations can be found in the `configs` folder to help get started with code engine use cases:

- [mcp.vpc.backup.json](configs/mcp.vpc.backup.json) - Tools commonly used when working with backups for VPC resources
- [mcp.vpc.baremetal.json](configs/mcp.vpc.baremetal.json) - Tools commonly used when working with bare metal servers
- [mcp.vpc.cluster.json](configs/mcp.vpc.cluster.json) - Tools commonly used when working with VPC Cluster groups
- [mcp.vpc.instance.json](configs/mcp.vpc.instance.json) - Tools commonly used when working with Virtual Server Instances
- [mcp.vpc.lb.json](configs/mcp.vpc.lb.json) - Tools commonly used when working with Virtual Server load balancers
- [mcp.vpc.network.json](configs/mcp.vpc.network.json) - Tools commonly used when working with Virtual Server network resources
- [mcp.vpc.sec.json](configs/mcp.vpc.sec.json) - Tools commonly used when securing Virtual Private Cloud resources
- [mcp.vpc.volume.json](configs/mcp.vpc.volume.json) - Tools commonly used when working with Virtual Server storage volumes

Each of these configurations also includes the following essential tools:

- `project_*` - Working with Code Engine projects and setting the current Code Engine project context for code engine tools.
- `buildruns_*` - Working with Code Engine builds and logs
- `assist` - Detailed IBM Cloud Assistance "Assist me with IBMCLOUD_TOPIC..."
- `resource-groups` - Getting lists of the available resource groups
- `catalog_locations` - Getting available regions
- `target` - Change the account, resource group, region or cloud API endpoint being used as the current working context for tools.

## üó£Ô∏è Prompts

The MCP Prompt feature is not currently implemented in the IBM Cloud MCP Servers, however, here are some prompts that you can 
use to get started using the tools:

### Common

- üó£Ô∏è Assist me with `IBM_CLOUD_TOPIC`
- üó£Ô∏è What resource groups are in my account?
- üó£Ô∏è Target the `RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME` resource group
- üó£Ô∏è List all code engine projects
- üó£Ô∏è Select the `CODE_ENGINE_PROJECT_NAME` project to work with

> NOTE: The above commands are from the [core](../core/README.md) set of tools and included in the code engine configuration examples above.  There are many other core commands for working with access, accounts, users, services, resource searching, etc. that can be used simply by adding the tool names to the config.

## üßæ Prerequisites

To build, run, and deploy this project, you will need the following installed:

* `make`
* Containerization tool: `podman` or `docker`
* `curl` (for testing)
* [`hadolint`](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint?tab=readme-ov-file#install) (for linting Containerfiles)
* [`dockle`](https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle) (for linting container images)
* [`trivy`](https://trivy.dev/v0.60/getting-started/installation/) (for scanning container images for vulnerabilities)
* IBM Cloud CLI with `container-registry` and `code-engine` plugins

## üóúÔ∏è Building the Container Image

The project uses a `Containerfile` to define the container image. You can build the image using either Podman or Docker via the Makefile targets.

An optional paramater of `IBMCLOUD_PLUGINS=one,two,three` can be added to the following build commands. All plugins will be installed if this is not provided.

* **Using Podman (Production image):**

    ```bash
    make podman
    ```

* **Using Podman (Development image):**

    ```bash
    make podman-dev
    ```

* **Using Docker (Production image):**

    ```bash
    make docker
    ```

* **Using Docker (Development image):**

    ```bash
    make docker-dev
    ```

## üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running the Container with an MCP Client

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "ibmcloud-core": {
            "command": "/opt/podman/bin/podman",
            "args": [
                "run",
                "--platform=linux/arm64",
                "-p",
                "4444:4444",
                "-i",
                "--rm",
                "-e",
                "IBMCLOUD_API_KEY",
                "-e",
                "IBMCLOUD_MCP_TOOLS",
                "ibmcloud-mcpserver/ibmcloud-mcpserver"
            ],
            "env": {
                "IBMCLOUD_API_KEY": "<Your API key",
                "IBMCLOUD_MCP_TOOLS": "comma,separated,list,of,tools,to,enable"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## üèÉüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Running the Container Locally

You can run the built container image locally using the `make` targets for Podman or Docker.

Ensure you have a `.env` file in the project root. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set the values.

* **Running with Podman (HTTP on port 4444):**

    ```bash
    make podman-run
    ```

* **Running with Podman (HTTPS on port 4444):**

    ```bash
    make podman-run-ssl
    ```

* **Running with Docker (HTTP on port 4444):**

    ```bash
    make docker-run
    ```

* **Running with Docker (HTTPS on port 4444):**

    ```bash
    make docker-run-ssl
    ```

## ‚úãüèº Stopping the Container

Stop and remove the running container instance:

* **Using Podman:**

    ```bash
    make podman-stop
    ```

* **Using Docker:**

    ```bash
    make docker-stop
    ```

## üß™ Testing the Container

Use `curl` to quickly test the running container endpoint:

* **Using Podman:**

    ```bash
    make podman-test
    ```

* **Using Docker:**

    ```bash
    make docker-test
    ```

## üëÆüèº Vulnerability Scanning

The Makefile includes targets for scanning your `Containerfile` and built images for vulnerabilities and best practices.

* **Scan image for CVEs (HIGH/CRITICAL) using Trivy:**

    ```bash
    make trivy
    ```

    *Requires Podman socket enabled (`systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket`)*

* **Lint container image using Dockle:**

    ```bash
    make dockle
    ```

* **Lint Containerfile(s) using Hadolint:**

    ```bash
    make hadolint
    ```
